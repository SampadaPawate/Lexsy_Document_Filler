## 📝 What to Know Before Submitting

### Environment Setup Required

**Critical**: You MUST set up environment variables!

Create `.env.local` with:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

Without this, the app won't work!

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin [your-repo-url]
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Go to vercel.com
   - Import GitHub repo
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Deploy

3. **Test Live**:
   - Upload sample document
   - Complete flow
   - Download and verify

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Test locally (works perfectly)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (accessible)
- [ ] Test deployed version (works)
- [ ] Push to GitHub (public repo)
- [ ] Prepare CV (PDF)
- [ ] Record Loom (under 2 minutes)
- [ ] Review SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Placeholder Detection Algorithm

```typescript
// Patterns recognized:
[Company Name]     → COMPANY_NAME
{{investor}}       → INVESTOR
<date>            → DATE
_______           → BLANK_1, BLANK_2, etc.
```

### AI Conversation Strategy

```typescript
System Prompt:
- "You are a legal document assistant"
- "Ask for ONE field at a time"
- "Extract values from responses"
- "Validate format"
- "Move to next field"
```

### State Management

```typescript
conversationState = {
  messages: ChatMessage[],
  filledPlaceholders: Record<string, string>,
  currentPlaceholderIndex: number
}
```

---

## 🔍 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Test Flow

1. **Upload**: Try sample SAFE document
2. **Chat**: Answer questions naturally
3. **Complete**: Fill all fields
4. **Generate**: Create document
5. **Download**: Get and open file
6. **Verify**: Check all placeholders filled

### Test Data

```
Company Name: Acme Corporation
Investor Name: Jane Investor
Purchase Amount: $100,000
Valuation Cap: $5,000,000
Date: December 31, 2024
State: Delaware
```

### Edge Cases to Test

- Very long company names
- Special characters (& $ #)
- Multiple word responses
- Currency formats
- Date formats
- Empty responses (should be prevented)
